**The Problem:** 
    > Describe the problem your project will address
    > Who is affected?
    > What are the impacts of this problem (locally, nationally, globally)?
    > Who
    
 **The Vision:** 
    >Who you’re working with, or hope to work with
    >What you’re doing
    >Who you’re doing it for, your audience 
    >Why you’re doing this, the impact or change you hope to make

Does this resource (or one nearly identical) already exist at Mozilla, or elsewhere?
yes
no
If resources like the one you plan to make already exist, what makes your project different or special? *
Provide links to any reference materials or sources of inspriation.

Who is your audience? *
(location, age, gender, profession, level of familiarity with topic, level of comfort with technology, etc)
What are their needs for this work? How will they use the skills/knowlege? *
What are motivators for these learners? *
These learning motivations or successes that can happen in-session to make the experience more rewarding like: seeing some sort of finished product, expressing themselves creatively, checking off tasks or boxes, getting some sort of recognition or score, etc
What are potential stumbling blocks? *
What might be tricky about the content or format for these users/learners? What are other constriants (time, urgency, etc)
Include a short persona for this audience: *
Example: Rashid is a PhD student in astronomy at a university in Southern England. Rashid took an intro Java programming course long ago, as an undergrad, but his research work requires Python skills. He attended a two-day Software Carpentry workshop at his institution. He found the training valuable but has encountered difficulties in debugging and troubleshooting since the workshop, and is struggling on his own.
Anything else crtical to keep in mind about your users?
What are ways you might involve your audience in the creation and iteration of this resource?
Are there opportunities for some members of your target audience participate or collaborate-- by giving feedback or advice, testing out drafts, being part of a design or production sprint, etc?

What is the goal of this resource? What should users do/do differently after they use it?
To start, think of the Minimum Viable Product, the bare-bones, pure and simple version what needs to be accomplished. List concrete tasks, skills, or chunks of knowledge if possible (for example "understand version control" "make a pull request" "navigate the interface with some ease")

**TECHNOLOGY:** A timer or stopwatch to time your freewrites. Pen and paper are recommended here, over typing into a computer. 


1. Work from [the document](https://gist.github.com/auremoser/9461e9ea62c5b3d7b87794158db4342c) we used at onboarding 
2. Work on your Open Canvas and document your goals in your own folder.
