# Project brief template 

**The goal of this exercise is to create a 1-3 page document that details your project to an audience of informed peers (colleagues, collaborators, funders, institutions, etc) and to help you develop a realistic assessment of resources and timeline for your project.** 


# Part 1: Brainstorming you Vision 
> A project planning exercise
## The Problem: 

### Describe the problem your project will address. (2-5 sentences) 
>Big picture to small scale.

- Who are the agents or players involved and peripheral to the issue?
- What are the consequences of this problem?
 - locally, nationally, globally
- Who is not paying attention to this problem?
    
## The Vision:
 
### How does your project address the problem? (2-5 sentences)

- What is the impact or change you hope to make?
- What is the value of the project?
 
### Who is the audience? 
>Describe the people who will use and/or participate in your project.

- What are their needs in order to participate in the project.
- Are there prerequisites for participation in the project.
- Will they participate in the formation of the project, if so, how?
- How will they access the project during formation and once it's complete.
- Write participant or user personas, if appropriate.

### Who/what resources already exist to address the problem?

- What are the gaps in existing systems? 
- Why have other approaches failed?
- How is this approach special or different?

### What are the intended outcomes? 
>Outcomes are the change your project is intended to realize, as well as significant indicators of progress along the way. 
>Outcomes are separate from Outputs. For example, running a basic markdown class is an output, and students learning to write in markdown is an outcome. 

- What does success look like for your project? 
- What results will this project achieve? 
- What will your project change or impact?
- How will you measure that change? (Put the short version here, see also Assessment section below to expand on this.)

### Who are your collaborators? 

- What role will each collaborator play?
- How will you communicate?
- What will motivate your collaborators to work with you and stay engaged?
- What makes you/collaborators uniquely positioned to solve the problem?

### What will define the completion of your project?

- How will your project be sustained?
  -Beyond 6 mo, beyond 1 yr, indefinitely?
- Will users/participants be involved in iteration and sustaining the project?

## What are the *core ideas* of your project?
>Brainstorm here to get central concepts down to *2-3 core ideas*, not outputs, high level concepts central to your project, possibly outcomes. 

- Impact/influence? 
- Inform/educate? 
- Facilitate/remove barriers? 
- Transform? What will be different? What will people do differently?

## Fellowship or organization priorities
> List the priorities of your fellowship/job/organization that this project addresses.

- Add your fellowship/job/organization themes here
- Open source
- Community building
- Open education
- Openly developed resource
- Open science
- Open web
- Open access
- Data sharing
- Open- friendly policy
- Cultural change

# Part 2: Developing a Practical Plan
  
## What resources are required for the project to succeed?

- Money? 
- Time?
- Expertise? 
- Infrastructure?
- Permission?
- Other resources?
 
## What is the minimum viable version of your project?

- How will you know when the project is done?

## What is your process going to look like? 
 > Write out, in a stream of consciousness style, how this project will unfold. Be as detailed as possible. What are the critical moments? What roadblocks are you likely to encounter? Use this exercise to identify key milestones and potential issues. 
 
 - What are the outputs of your project? 
  - Tie each output to an outcome from earlier in the exercise. 
 
# The timeline: 
> Using your process narrative and targeted outcomes, break your project down into a series to sprints between now and the end point. 
> Include dates, events, deadlines and specifics where possible.

- Example two week sprint:
 - List of activities, outputs, milestones
 - List of roadblocks/issues
 - List collaborators and their responsibilities
 - List resources needed for sprint
 
## Assessment:
> How will you assess the success of the project?

- What outcomes do you hope to achieve?
 - What output is each outcome tied to?
 - How can these outcomes be measured?
- How will users assess your project?
- How will outside bodies assess your project?

- Be sure to ask simple questions that get to the heart of your intended outcomes.
 - Did it work? (Rather than did it happen.)
 - How well is it working?
