##Project brief template

**The Challenge:** 

 **The Vision:** 
    Who you’re working with, or hope to work with
    What you’re doing
    Who you’re doing it for, your audience (may be same as b)
    Why you’re doing this, the impact or change you hope to make

**The proposal:** Solo writing exercise.  Use all of the time you’re allotted for each exercise. If you get stuck, try to keep going. Keeping your pen moving, free associate, don’t be judgemental, encourage any idea or thought that comes to mind. 

**TECHNOLOGY:** A timer or stopwatch to time your freewrites. Pen and paper are recommended here, over typing into a computer.
