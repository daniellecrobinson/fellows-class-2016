[Science Hack Day Portland](http://portland.sciencehackday.org/) | Portland, OR | October 7-8, 2016 | 📋 Organizer | Secured funding, organized catering, materials, and support for speakers and participants with an interdisciplinary team.  The event included a kickoff party, 24-hours of hackathon time in a supportive enviornment, and closing project demos. This event was free, open to the public, and featured free access to three 3-D printes, microcontrolers, hardware, and software expertise. Here are some of the outcomes Science Hack Day PDX 2016 facilitated: long term and cross-community collaborations; technology confidence and skill building through hands on experiences with code and hardware; the creation of new and collaborative learning communities, such as OHSU’s BioData Club; an active community of open science practitioners, which spans open source, open hardware, and open data enthusiasts.
