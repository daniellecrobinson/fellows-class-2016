As part of the 2016 Mozilla Fellows for Science program, I completed/participated in the following September - December 2016: 

In September, I collaborated with [Women in Science Portland](http://wisportland.weebly.com/) and [ChickTech PDX] (https://portland.chicktech.org/) to host a three part workshop on [career development and negotiation for women in technical fields] (https://science.mozilla.org/blog/reflections-on-women-in-stem) with [Jessica Williams] (http://superwomanproject.com/). This workshop series brought ecologists, cyber security experts, data scientists, neuroscientists, software developers, project managers, actuaries, postdocs, PhD candidates, bioinformatitans, and other technical professional together in a welcoming environment to talk about our careers goals. 
Building community is something I'd like to focus on in my fellowship. Academic resaerch can be isolating, and this and I continued the theme of local community building with
