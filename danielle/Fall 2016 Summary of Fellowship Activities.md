As part of the 2016 Mozilla Fellows for Science program, I completed/participated in the following September - December 2016: 

In September, I collaborated with [Women in Science Portland](http://wisportland.weebly.com/) and [ChickTech PDX](https://portland.chicktech.org/) to host a three part workshop on [career development and negotiation for women in technical fields](https://science.mozilla.org/blog/reflections-on-women-in-stem) with [Jessica Williams](http://superwomanproject.com/). This workshop series brought ecologists, cyber security experts, data scientists, neuroscientists, software developers, project managers, actuaries, postdocs, PhD candidates, bioinformatitans, and other technical professional together in a welcoming environment to talk about our careers goals. 
Building community enables scientists to gain exposure to new tools and workflows.  Academic research, particulary the branch of wet lab biology I come from, does not tend to embrace open-source tools and ideals. Expanding my scientific community to include people from across the scientific spectrum has enhanced my scientific productivity. To continue the theme of local community building within Portland's diverse scientific and tech communities, I collaborated with an incredible team of scientists, engineers, and coders to produce [Science Hack Day Portland](http://portland.sciencehackday.org/) in October. [Jenny Molloy](https://twitter.com/jenny_molloy?lang=en) spoke about hacking hardware, [Dietrich Ayala](https://twitter.com/dietrich) spoke about harnessing the power of the internet of things for people not for profit, and [Hack Oregon](http://www.hackoregon.org/) founder [Catherine Nikolovski](https://twitter.com/cat_nikolovski?lang=en). Mozilla donated [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) and hardware for th event, and the indespensible [Alex Challey](https://twitter.com/alexchally) of Portland State University's Science Support Shop brought along three 3-D printers and managed the design workstation for people to prototype on site. At the event, I lead a molecular biology team to use CRISPR technology to edit the yeast genome with hacked equipment. It was a fantastic event, and the 3D printers ran all night with 35 print jobs making over 75 unique objects during the 24 hour hack. More on the teams and projects can be found [here](https://storify.com/rchampieux/science-hack-day-portland).
As a part of my Fellowship with Mozilla Science Lab, I joined the [Science](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/fellowships/fellows), [Web](https://advocacy.mozilla.org/en-US/open-web-fellows/fellows2016), and [Journalism](https://opennews.org/what/fellowships/info/) fellows at [Mozilla Festival](https://mozillafestival.org/) in London in late October. At Mozfest, I presented a talk: "The open revolution is science and why it needs you" and participated in some inspiring workshops and discussions. 
Two weeks after Mozfest, I traveled to Washington DC for the third [OpenCon](http://www.opencon2016.org/updates/). Prior to the OpenCon,  Kirstie Whitacker and I developed a website to collect "agony aunt" style questions and answers to isues facing researchers who want to work openly called [Open Advice](https://kirstiejane.github.io/OpenAdvice/). At OpenCon, we gathered a group of contributors otgether and worked on the site. The work is onging, so feel free to [contribute a question or an answer](https://github.com/KirstieJane/OpenAdvice)! OpenCon's unique Advocacy Day matches conference atendees with relvant representatives or interest groups to advocate for policies to support open science. This year, advocacy day took place just six days after the presidential election. Myself, along with a group of [students and librarians from around Oregon](https://twitter.com/Neurosarda/status/798242797103026176), met with [Ron Wyden's staff](https://opencon2016.sched.com/event/8uTk/advocacy-meeting-senator-ron-wyden-d-or?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) to discuss the [Fair Access to Science and Technology Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Access_to_Science_and_Technology_Research_Act) (FASTR). I then rushed across town to lead a meeting of 20 OpenCon attendees with the [National Academy of Sciences](https://opencon2016.sched.com/event/8uTZ/advocacy-meeting-national-academy-of-sciences?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) (NAS) with Dr. George Strawn, Board Director for the Policy and Global Affairs Division at the National Academy of Sciences, and Dr. Marcia McNutt, President of the National Academy of Sciences. We advocated for data sharing and open access, more support for early career researchers, voiced our concerns about diversity and inclusion in the sciences.
I then returned to Portland to complete and defend my disseration (December 5, 2016).
