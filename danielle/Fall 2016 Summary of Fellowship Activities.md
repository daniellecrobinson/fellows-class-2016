As part of the 2016 Mozilla Fellows for Science program, I completed/participated in the following September - December 2016: 

In September, I collaborated with [Women in Science Portland](http://wisportland.weebly.com/) and [ChickTech PDX](https://portland.chicktech.org/) to host a three part workshop on [career development and negotiation for women in technical fields](https://science.mozilla.org/blog/reflections-on-women-in-stem) with [Jessica Williams](http://superwomanproject.com/). This workshop series brought ecologists, cyber security experts, data scientists, neuroscientists, software developers, project managers, actuaries, postdocs, PhD candidates, bioinformatitans, and other technical professional together in a welcoming environment to talk about our careers goals. 
Building community is something I'd like to focus on in my fellowship. Academic research, particulary the branch of wet lab biology I come from, does not tend to embrace open-source tools and ideals. Expanding my scientific community to include people from across the scientific spectrum has enhanced my scientific productivity. To continue the theme of local community building within Portland's diverse scientific and tech communities, I collaborated with an incredible team of scientists, engineers, and coders to produce [Science Hack Day Portland](http://portland.sciencehackday.org/) in October.  I lead a molecular biology team to use CRISPR technology to edit the yeast genome, more detail on the teams and projects can be found [here](https://storify.com/rchampieux/science-hack-day-portland).
