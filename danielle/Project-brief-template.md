##Project brief template

**The goal of this exercise is to create a 1-3 page document that details your project to an audience of informed peers (colleagues, colaborators, funders, institutions, etc) and to help you develop a realistic assessment of resources and timeline for your project.** 

**Fellowship Themes:**
List the priorities of your fellowship that this project addresses.

- Open source
- Community building
- Open education
- Openly developed resource
- Open science
- Open web
- Open access
- Data sharing
- Open- friendly policy
- Add your fellowship themes here

**The Problem:** 

Describe the problem your project will address. (2-5 sentences) 
>Large to small scale.

- Who are the agents or players involved and peripheral to the issue?
- What are the concequences of this problem?
 - locally, nationally, globally
- Who is not paying attention to this problem?

- Write participant or user personas, if appropriate.
 
What are your intended outcomes? 
>Outcomes do not need the be the end point, but significant indicators of progress. 
>Outputs (running a basic R course) are separate from outcomes (students gaining familiarity with coding)

- What is the result this project will achieve, what is the value of the project?
- What will your project change or impact?
- What does success look like for your project or your community?
- How will you measure that change (put the short version here, see also Assessment section below to expand on this)

Who are your collaborators? 

- What makes you/collaborators uniquely positioned to solve the problem?

How will this project be sustained? 

- Beyond 6 mo, beyond 1 yr, indefinitely?
- Will users/participants be involved in itteration and sustaining the project?
 
 
**The proposal:** 
 
What are the *core ideas* of your project?
>Brainstorm here to get central concepts down to *2-3 core ideas*. 

- Impact/influence? 
- What are the outputs of your project? Tie each output to an outcome. 
- Inform/educate? 
- Facilitate/remove barriers? 
- Transfom? What will be different? What will people do differently?
  
  
What resources are required for the project to succeed?

- Money? 
- Time?
- Collaborations? 
- Infrastructure?
 
 
What is the minimum viable version of your project?

- How will you know when the project is done?
 
 
Who/what resources exist to address the problem now?

- What are the gaps in exisiting systems? 
- Why have other approaches failed?
- How is this appraoch special or different?
 
**The process:** 

What is your process going to look like? 
 > Write out, stream of consiouness style how this project would unfold. Be as detailed as possible. What are the critical moments? What caveats/roadblocks are coming up? Use this exercise to identify key milestones. Now condense that into a timeline below. 
 
**The timeline:** 

Include dates, events, deadlines and specifics where possible

- Two week sprint goal:
 - List of tasks
 - List of roadblocks/issues
 - 1 milestone
    
- One month goal: 
 - List of tasks
 - List of roadblocks/issues
 - 1 milestone
 - New sprint
    
- Three month goal:
 - Milestones completed
 - Milestones to do
 - New sprint
    
- 6 month goal
 - Milestones completed
 - Milestones to do
 - New sprint
    
- Mozfest goal
 - Milestones completed
 - New sprint
 
**Assessment:** 
How will you assess your project?

- What outcomes do you hope to acheive?
 - What output is each outcome tied to?
 - How can these outcomes be measured?
- How will users assess your project?
- How will outside bodies assess your project?
- Be sure to ask simple questions that get to the heart of your intended outcomes.
 - Did it work? (Rather than did it happen.)
 - How well is it working?
